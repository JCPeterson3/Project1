# Expense Reimbursement System (Project 1)

## Project Description
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the reimbursements for employees within the company. Employees can login and view their reimbursement tickets, as well as add new reimbursement tickets. Finance managers can login and view all reimbursements for the company, but they cannot create a new reimbursement themselves. Finance managers can filter the reimbursement tickets by the tickets' status and they have the power to approve and deny all reimbursement tickets in the system.

## Technologies Used
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - AJAX
  - SQL
  - Hibernate
  - Java
  - Javalin
  - Mockito
  - JUnit

## Features
Currently the system can
  - Have a user login bringing them to an employee or finance manager page
  - Employees can add a new reimbursement
  - Finance Managers can view all reimbursement tickets, filter reimburement tickets by status and approve/deny a reimbursement ticket

Future upgrades to the system could be:
  - Adding more ways to filter
  - Allowing images to be attached to reimbursement tickets as a receipt
